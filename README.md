# Palindrome Checker

This project implements a simple palindrome checker using a stack in C++. The program checks if a given string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).

## Features

- Uses a stack data structure to reverse the string.
- Compares the reversed string with the original string to determine if it is a palindrome.
**Code Explanation**
The Stack class contains methods to manage stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.
The ispalindrome method takes a string as input, pushes each character onto the stack, and then pops them off to compare with the original string.
